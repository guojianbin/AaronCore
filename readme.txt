Project Description

Many newbie developers will put question: "How to get project standardization and optimization?!". Certainly, there are many ways to solve this problem if asks master Google, but you must get best one in many results; it take you all day. So, I have researched, read many techno. books (design pattern, C# head first,...), to help you get this.

It's a special architect (written base on C# and built with Entity Framework) be used to build programs as web-app (ASP.NET WebForms and ASP.NET MVC), windows-app; help your project become standardization. It provides the standard platform, including core systems, data flows and other utilities,... ready to serve a normal web-app (support Sqlserver, sqlce).

As I said above, first you install Entity Framework, and then get Aaron Core at Nuget with command:

Install-Package Aaron.Core
